        <h2>Introduction</h2>        
        <p>Welcome to Scrapbook MAF Creator.</p>
        <p>
          Scrapbook MAF Creator is an add-on for the excellent Scrapbook extension for Firefox which allows you to create a MAF (Mozilla Archive Format)
          file from a stored web site. The Mozilla Archive Format stores a web page and it's related content in a zip archive. You can learn more about MAF at
          the <a href="http://maf.mozdev.org/">Mozilla Archive Format home page</a>. The add-on available at the MAF home page or the 
          <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-RU/firefox/addon/212">Firefox add-ons site</a>, allows you to create MAF archives from any web page from 
          within Firefox. It has some great features and it will create archives from pages stored with Scrapbook but it has the limitation of not storing additional 
          data that is downloaded and stored with scrapbook, such as linked files or site data deeper than the front page. That's because MAF is really designed
          to store single pages. MAF stores the top page and links to the remaining data on your hard drive, which must therefore remain where it is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Enter Scrapbook MAF Creator.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scrapbook MAF Creator stores <em>all</em> of your stored site data in the MAF archive. Once the stored site has been archived, you can delete it from Scrapbook,
          secure in the knowledge that it is safely and completely stored for later reference. This works well because Scrapbook has already flattened the site
          structure and rewritten the links. Now you can store an entire web site with all attachments and related files directly from Scrapbook and, when you want
          to refer to it again, the entire site is just a double-click away. The MAF archive will load the site into Firefox just as if you were viewing the original.
          External links work just as they always did. Even better, you can store multiple Scrapbooked sites into one MAF archive that, when opened, will open each
          site in it's own tab. So, you can store a group of related sites together and open them as one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, that's pretty cool.
